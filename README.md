# Experiments.Blazor

This repo contains several experiments with building .NET Blazor applications.

> Note that these applications are experiments and are not necessarily production ready code. Shortcuts or hacks may have been made to further the learning or experimentation process. 

## SPA Site

These projects are based on the [Cofoundry SPA example application](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/Cofoundry.Samples.SPASite), ported from VueJs into Blazor. 

- [SPASite.BlazorServer](/src/SPASite.BlazorServer/README.md): Blazor app using the interactive server-side rendering render mode and direct sever-side data access.
- [SPASite.WebAssembly](/src/SPASite.BlazorWebAssembly/SPASite.BlazorWebAssembly/README.md): Blazor app using the WebAssembly client-side rendering mode and minimal APIs for data access.

## Experiments.Blazor.MudBlazorAdmin

- [Experiments.Blazor.MudBlazorAdmin](/src/Experiments.Blazor.MudBlazorAdmin/README.md) This is a sandbox application for experimenting with [MudBlazor](https://www.mudblazor.com/) components to build an admin panel interface.
